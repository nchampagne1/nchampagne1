## Hi there, I am Nahallah!👋🏾👩🏾‍💻
🔭Computer Science Sudent @ NJIT

Passionate about creating and learning though projects, I focus on using learning through projects and creating impactful grounded projects. I am especially curious about how machine learning can shape real-world tools, and I love building projects that blend creativity with code.

💡 I am currently working on a fullstack web application, and learning new frameworks along the way. 

🧠 Intrested in exploring more frameworks and tools related to ML, Python, and backend architecture.

🌱 Always learning new technologys, including TensorFlow/Keras.

Let’s connect, collab, or just swap cool project ideas.
