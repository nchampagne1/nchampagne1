## Hi there, I am Nahallah!👋🏾👩🏾‍💻
🔭Computer Science Sudent @ NJIT

Passionate about creating and learning though projects, I focus on using learning through projects and creating impactful grounded projects. I am especially curious about how machine learning can shape real-world tools, and I love building projects that blend creativity with code. ![ThumbsUpKedetGIF](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8e6f608-6a7c-4775-94f1-5180ba5a844c)

💡 I work on apps that solve everyday problems (and a few that just spark joy)

🧠 Currently diving deep into ML, Python, and backend architecture

🌱 Always learning new technologys, including TensorFlow/Keras

Let’s connect, collab, or just swap cool project ideas.
